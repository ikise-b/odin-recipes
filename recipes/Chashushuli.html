        <p>Ostri is another typical Georgian food - a spicy beef stew resembling an European goulash. The beef is cooked together with tomatoes and mushrooms and further flavored with generous amount of garlic, spices and herbs. It´s a hearty, filling dish ideal for chilly evenings.</p>
        <p>On some restaurant menus, you will find also a similar dish named <em>chashushuli</em>. As a culinary layman, they both looked same to me. Only later, a friend explained me the difference. During the preparation of ostri, ingredients are cooked together from the beginning. But in case of <em>chashushuli</em>, the meat is first briefly fried and then cooked in its own oil - tomatoes and mushrooms are added only much later.</p>
